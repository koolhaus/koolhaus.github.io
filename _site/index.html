            <h1>What is the Kool?</h1>

            <p> We can say that there are two ingredients: Vision and Process.</p>
            <p>Vision is inscrutable. It’s what you have to bring to the table to play. It is the impetus for process. Process, on the other hand, is empirical. Without it, Vision is unrefined and unrealized.</p>
            <p>Vision is art, process is science. Separately they are impotent but together they are fruitful. 'When God considers the ideal relationship between Adam, whom He has just created, and the spouse He is about to create, the phrase in the original Hebrew is Eizer K’negdo, “a helper against him.” In this sense, vision and process work against each    other, but toward their ultimate shared goal.</p>
            <p>'Vision and Process must collaborate. This isn’t about compromising. Black and white are opposites; compromise mutes contrasts and turns everything grey. In contrast black and white integrate and collaborate to produce a picture of depth— a new dimension. The Kool is about getting to this new dimension.</p>
 
            <p>In this new dimension, the rules are different. Getting here requires creating new land, not dividing up existing territory. Focus on creating value, not capturing value. You don’t win by defeating your competition. You win by transcending it.</p>
            <p>That, is kool.</p>

                <h2>1. Start with Why</h2>
                <p class='cardText'>You have to know why you’re doing what you’re doing. If you really in fact should be doing what you’re doing. What do you want the world to look like when you're done? How will you know you've achieved your vision? Understanding what your real motivations are, and what you’re trying to get out of it. Otherwise you won’t be able to build your product with intention, communicate your vision to anyone else, or draw anyone to your cause.</p>

                <p class='cardText'>You know what you want. Now how do you get it? Don't meander like the masses. Knowing why you’re doing what you’re doing, you’ve got ideas about how to get it done. But those ideas need to be tested, as yet, they’re just sparks. And there’s one key question you’ve got to answer:</p>

                now that you’ve got a crystal clear idea of why you’re doing what you’re doing and where you want to go, and a well-formed measurable hypothesis about how to get there. It’s time to build a product experiment that will efficiently confirm or invalidate your hypotheses with metrics that will glean data for you to draw insight from. We help you execute experiments that give you the insights you need to confirm or disprove your critical business hypotheses. So that you can move toward your vision as quickly as possible without wasting, time, effort, or money.
